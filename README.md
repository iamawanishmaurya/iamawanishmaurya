👋 Hi, I'm Awanish Maurya! I exist in a quantum superposition of code and caffeine. When I'm not debugging, I'm probably chasing after semicolons that escaped my code. 🕵️‍♂️
I'm passionate about software development, machine learning, and open-source projects. Currently, I'm learning about natural language processing and contributing to exciting repositories. Let's collaborate! 

🚀 **Projects:**
1. **Quantum Chatbot**: Predicts the future (with a 50% chance of accuracy). Accepting pull requests from alternate realities.
2. **Infinite Loop Detector**: Because sometimes, recursion needs a reality check.
3. **404 Not Found**: A mysterious project that doesn't exist yet. Contribute by adding nothing!

🚀 **Coming Soon: Project Quantum**
A quantum-inspired chatbot that predicts the future (or at least tries to). Stay tuned!

🎮 **Achievements Unlocked:**
-**Bug Whisperer**
Debugged a race condition blindfolded. +50 UP!
- **Syntax Whisperer**: Translated Python into Klingon without a dictionary.
- **Merge Conflict Survivor**: Merged 42 conflicting branches simultaneously. Lost a few brain cells in the process.

🔗 **Connect with Me:**
- Twitter: Where I tweet cryptic code snippets.
- LinkedIn: Let's connect in this non-quantum dimension!
